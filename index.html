                        <strong>Title: </strong>From Simple to Complex QA
                        <br>
                        <strong>Speaker: </strong><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hovy">Eduard Hovy</a>
                        <br>
                        <strong> Abstract: </strong>In modern automated QA research, what differentiates simple/shallow
                        from complex/deep QA? Early QA research developed pattern-learning and -matching techniques to
                        identify the appropriate factoid answer(s), and this approach has been taken a step further
                        recently by recent neural architectures that learn and apply more-flexible generalized
                        word/type-sequence ‘patterns’. However, many QA tasks require some sort of intermediate
                        reasoning or other inference procedures more complex than generalization over pattern-anchored
                        words and phrases. In one approach, people focus on the automated construction of small access
                        functions to locate the answer in structured resources like tables or databases. But much (or
                        most) knowledge is not structured, and what to do in this case is unclear. Most current ‘deep’
                        QA approaches take a one-size-fits-all approach in which they essentially hope that a
                        multi-layer neural architecture will somehow learn to encode inference steps automatically. The
                        main problem facing this line of research is the difficulty in defining exactly what kinds of
                        reasoning are relevant, and what knowledge resources are required to support them. If all
                        relevant knowledge is apparent on the surface of the question material, then shallow
                        pattern-matching techniques (perhaps involving combinations of patterns) can surely be developed
                        using simple/shallow methods. But if not, then (at least some of) the relevant knowledge is
                        either internal to the QA system or resides in some additional, external resource (like the
                        web), which makes the design and construction of general comprehensive datasets and evaluations
                        very difficult. (In fact, the same problem faces all in-depth semantic analysis research topics,
                        including entailment, machine reading, semantic information extraction, and more.) How should
                        the Complex-QA community respond to this conundrum? In this talk I outline the problem, define
                        four levels of QA, and propose a general direction for future research.

                        <strong> Abstract: </strong>
                        The identification of complex semantic graph structures such as events and entity relations from
                        unstructured texts, already a challenging Information Extraction task, is doubly difficult to
                        extract from sources written in under-resourced and under-annotated languages. We investigate
                        the suitability of cross-lingual cross-media graph structure transfer techniques for these
                        tasks. Previous efforts on cross-lingual transfer are limited to sequence level. In contrast, we
                        observe that relational facts are typically expressed by identifiable structured graph patterns
                        across multiple languages and data modalities. We exploit relation- and event-relevant
                        language-universal and modality-universal features, leveraging both symbolic (including
                        part-of-speech and dependency path) and distributional (including type representation and
                        contextualized representation) information. We then represent all entity mentions, event
                        triggers, and contexts into this complex and structured multilingual common space, using graph
                        convolutional networks. In this way all the sentences from multiple languages, along with visual
                        objects from images are represented as one shared unified graph representation. We then train a
                        relation or event extractor from source language annotations and apply it to the target language
                        and images. Extensive experiments on cross-lingual and cross-media relation and event transfer
                        demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art supervised
                        models trained on up to 3,000 manually annotated mentions, and dramatically outperforms methods
                        learned from flat representation. I will show a preliminary demo on applying the resultant event
                        knowledge base for automatic history book generation.

                        is a good opportunity to move beyond traditional supervised learning methods. The core research
                        question that I will address in this talk is the following: What is self-supervised learning?
                        What is the success story behind BERT and XLNet? How can we design self-supervised deep learning
                        methods to operate over rich language and knowledge representations? In this talk, I will
                        describe some examples of my work in advancing the state-of-the-arts in methods of
                        self-supervised learning for NLP, including: 1) AREL, a self-adaptive inverse reinforcement
                        learning agent for visual storytelling; and 2) Self-supervised learning that goes beyond
                        surface-level representation learning. I will conclude this talk by describing my other research
                        interests in the interdisciplinary field of AI/ML/NLP/Vision.

                        <strong>Title: Linking Languages Across Space and Time</strong>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Speaker: </strong><a href="http://john.mccr.ae/">John McCrae</a>
                        <br>
                        <strong> Abstract:</strong> NLP is moving increasingly from working on only a few well-resourced languages to meet the challenges of a globalising world connected through the internet. As such, connecting all these languages is of increasing importance and new technologies to link across language boundaries are necessary. I will present some results from the ELEXIS (European Lexicographic Infrastructure) project, which aims to connect lexicographers with NLP researchers across Europe and link their dictionaries through a new dictionary matrix. Secondly, I will talk about the Cardamom project, which aims to extend NLP technology to minority languages and also historical languages by exploiting information from well-resourced closely-related languages.
